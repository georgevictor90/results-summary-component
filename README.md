## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This small project helped me understand the importance of having a proper type scale system and spacing scale system established before tackling the project to reduce ambiguity. In this project i found myself quite often wasting time trying to guess values for paddings, margins, font-sizes, etc.

### Continued development

I will have to further look into spacing systems and type scales for use in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Applying whitespace in UX design](https://uxdesign.cc/whitespace-in-ui-design-44e332c8e4a) - This is a great article about applying whitespace in web development projects.
- [Type Scale](https://typescale.com/) - A great tool for generating type scale.
